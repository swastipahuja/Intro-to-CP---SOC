# Intro-to-CP-SOC

We have started coding i.e on different competitive coding platforms - codeforces, codechef, atcoder, leetcode etc.
Along with this we started by revising basic c++ programming and then learning about STL(Standard Template Library). Then we learnt about sets and maps.In the data structures, we learnt aabout disjoint sets, how to do their union and about sparse table.  Right now, we are working upon the introductory problems of DSA like - Weird algorithm, missing number etc. I look forward to cover DSA and DP in this course. And I am also enjoying giving contests on competitive coding sites.
Looking forward to learn more.

With the only pre-requisite of knowledge of CS101, It was an amazing learning experience to enhance this knowledge of STL, DSA and DP. 
We first brushed up with the basic programming questions on sites like Codechef, Codeforces, Gfg, etc.
Then we started with the c++ STL (Standard Template Library) to do questions short and decrease their time complexity. We started with competitive programming from the classic book - Competitive Programmer’s Handbook, by  Antti Laaksonen, which helped us a lot through the basics of CP. In the third week, we began with DSA basics like arrays and linked lists, including Union find and Range Minimum Query. We also solved the CSES problem sheet of Introductory problems and Dynamic Programming. We then went on to typical Data Structures like trees and graphs. 
Review meets were conducted whenever some students had difficulty understanding a certain topic or solving a particular question from one of the contests.
Along with all these learnings, I gave CP contests and solved some typical problems on DSA through various sites.

Challenges faced -
I was having a tough time implementing STL in my codes which constantly resulted in time complexity or memory complexity errors in my CP contest codes. I then asked my mentor about this and some of my friends who were into CP. At last, I took a course on GfG, DSA Self-Paced.

This course is pretty good and explains STL differently and exclusively for each and every topic. As I got to solve questions, particularly by STL, through this course, I overcame this challenge and successfully began giving CP  contests.

I enjoyed this project thoroughly, and it introduced me to DSA for the first time. At first, I had a tough time beginning any code in contests but now I am able to solve at least ⅖ or ⅗ questions from the contests. I now enjoy coding and do not give up too quickly. All thanks to my mentor and WnCC for putting up this project and giving me a chance to be a part of it. Looking forward to learning and exploring coding in more fields like analytics
