# Intro-to-CP-SOC

We have started coding i.e on different competitive coding platforms - codeforces, codechef, atcoder, leetcode etc.
Along with this by revising basic c++ programming and then learning about STL(Standard Template Library). Then we learnt about sets and maps.In the data structures, we learnt aabout disjoint sets, how to do their union and about sparse table.  Right now, we are working upon the introductory problems of DSA like - Weird algorithm, missing number etc. I look forward to cover DSA and DP in this course. And I am also enjoying giving contests on competitive coding sites.
Looking forward to learn more.
