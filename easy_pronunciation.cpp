Problem
Words that contain many consecutive consonants, like "schtschurowskia", are generally considered somewhat hard to pronounce.

We say that a word is hard to pronounce if it contains 44 or more consonants in a row; otherwise it is easy to pronounce. For example, "apple" and "polish" are easy to pronounce, but "schtschurowskia" is hard to pronounce.

You are given a string SS consisting of NN lowercase Latin characters. Determine whether it is easy to pronounce or not based on the rule above â€” print YES if it is easy to pronounce and NO otherwise.

For the purposes of this problem, the vowels are the characters \{a, e, i, o, u\}{a,e,i,o,u} and the consonants are the other 2121 characters.

    My code was wrong at first coz i did the same mistake and then I learnt that declaring string like this will take up more
